## <a name="introduction">Introduction</a>

This repository contains the code of a music playing app (Spotify Clone), made using Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Stripe & Supabase. The app replicates the core functionalities of Spotify, allowing users to discover, search, and play music. All songs and associated artwork are stored using Supabase, a backend-as-a-service (BaaS) platform. Users can subscribe to a Spotify plan using Stripe for recurring payments, and webhooks are set up to update Supabase when Stripe events occur.

## <a name="features">Features</a>

üëâ **User Authentication**: Users can sign up or log in to their accounts using their email and password, or authenticate with their GitHub account.

üëâ **Home Page**: Display the newest songs uploaded to Supabase, allowing users to discover the latest music.

üëâ **Search**: Users can search for artists or tracks.

üëâ **Music Player**: Play and control music tracks with features like play, pause, skip, and shuffle.

üëâ **Automatic Queue Management**: Playing a song automatically adds related songs or songs in the playlist to the queue for uninterrupted music playback.

üëâ **Favorite Songs**: Users can save their favorite songs and access them later.

üëâ **Upload Songs with Artwork**: Users can upload their own songs along with custom artwork, which is stored on Supabase.

üëâ **Subscription Plans**: Users can subscribe to different Spotify plans using Stripe for recurring payments.
